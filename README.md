# SUPERCOMPUTING


Course repository for "Supercomputing for Science" at William &amp; Mary

Students will maintain a similar personal Git repository that contains notes, scripts, etc.

All assignments must be pushed to their personal repo in order to receive a grade.

Students will maintain a .gitignore file to prevent any large data files or other "junk" from being pushed to the remote repo.
