1.
- hand-sowing seeds (still coated in their inoculum) into 1m x 1m plots (250 seeds per sq m)
- no additional inoculum added. We are selecting for and counting on priority effects, hoping the donor microbiome has a chance to start forming relationships with the seeds and taking up available niches, etc. before planting them out. This plays out in magrove inoculation trials (early inoculation works better)
2.
- We will collect seeds in May of year 0 (before this project would actually start or be potentially funded) for phase 1.
- We will collect the seeds for phase 2 in May of year 1.
- Summer, we will sterilize seeds, incubate them in a dormant state until fall for germination. This is the standard timeline for seagrass restoration work.
- Summer, we will also pick the ultimate outplanting sites based on local conditions and practitioner expertise. They use this timeline as well, typically.
- September, we will do resident baseline sampling of our two outplanting sites, as well as the donor inocula (N replicates for each) and quickly send off for sequencing at SeqCoast Genomics, LLC (Portsmouth, NH) 
- Late September, we will input the donor and resident communities into our trained model and make predictions about which inoculum sources will perform best at the chosen sites.
- October = outplanting the seeds (both states on same timeline, typically, but adaptable if local conditions warrant a delay)
- April, June, August = The 3 monitoring trips
- In the final monitoring trip (August), we will collect rhizosphere sediment samples from the established plots
- Future work will use these to update the model. The model is designed so it can learn as it goes, getting better over time. By inputting the new "final community" data along with environmental data and plant growth outcomes (bed establishment and persistence), the model can be even better in the future (We should bring this up here, but there is a separate section in the application for "future work" where we will want to drive this home.
- One contiguous outplanting site per state. 40 10x10 subplots, separated by at least 5 meters. Inoculum treatments will be spatially randomized among these 40 subplot in each state.
- Note that all the seeds for this will come from VIMS again. The NH people are working on permits and permission to plant VA seeds in NH waters (they don't think it will be an issue)
